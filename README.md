## Installing the application
- If you use an older toolbox-based version of Docker, uninstall it before you install the application.
- If you have other containers that run on your computer, stop them before you start the installation process of the application because your computer might have resource constraints.

THis will remove the older version of Docker Image and container. Finally relaunch the application to pull most recent Image.
